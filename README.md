# Garden Monitoring Tool

This repository contains the code and project report for the Garden Monitoring Tool developed as part of the MCS 7224 - Computer Vision course at Makerere University.

## Introduction

The Garden Monitoring Tool is a computer vision and machine learning-based system designed to detect and identify crops and grass in a garden. The tool utilizes traditional machine learning algorithms (KNN or Naïve Bayes) and deep learning models to perform classification tasks.

## Project Materials

The project materials, including the dataset and video, can be accessed through the following link: Project Materials.

### Tasks

#### Task 1: 
Building a KNN or Naïve Bayes Model
In this task, we build a garden monitoring tool using traditional machine learning. The steps involved are as follows:

Download the provided video and identify three crops and grass of interest.
Crop or annotate the identified crops and grass using an image cropping/annotating tool.
Analyze the cropped or annotated images and select suitable features for classification.
Develop a feature extraction algorithm to extract the identified features and build a training dataset.
Train a KNN or Naïve Bayes machine learning model using the training dataset.
Evaluate and report the performance of the trained model.
#### Task 2: 
Building a Deep Learning Model
In this task, we build a garden monitoring tool using deep learning. The steps involved are as follows:

Use the cropped or annotated images obtained in Task 1 for training dataset creation.
Perform image cleaning and pre-processing on the training dataset.
Choose a deep learning model of your choice and train it for crop and grass classification using the prepared dataset.
Evaluate and report the performance of the trained deep learning model.
#### Task 3: 
Compare and Analyze Results
In this task, we compare and analyze the results obtained from Task 1 and Task 2. We discuss the performance of the two models and provide insights into their strengths and limitations.

## Deliverables

The following deliverables are expected at the end of the project:

A project report (maximum 30 pages) in CVPR format, describing the project in a research paper-style format.
A PowerPoint presentation (maximum 20 slides) summarizing the project, including a link to the video presentation.
A video presentation (maximum 15 minutes) on YouTube, where the project is explained, and the developer appears in the video.
A GitHub repository containing the code to reproduce the project, with a link provided in the PowerPoint presentation.
## Grading

The project report accounts for 80% of the examination mark, while the presentation contributes 15%. Extra credit (up to 5%) may be awarded for creative applications of methods.
